# To run (locally):

1. Download or clone the repository

2. Enter the project folder in the terminal (Mac) or CMD prompt (Windows)

3. Run 'npm install -g live-server'

4. Run 'live-server'

5. Open localhost in the browser

# Usage

As shown in the short video above,

The canvas displays a number of healthy, infected and immune molecules.

The user can use the GUI controls to adjust the size and / or number of molecules on the canvas.

If an infected molecule comes in contact or collides with one that is healthy, there is a high probability that it will become infected.
