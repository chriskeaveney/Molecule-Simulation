# Molecule Simulation

This project was carried out in 2019 as my first semester assignment for the Creative Coding module of my college degree (Creative Computing in DÃºn Laoighre Institute of Art, Design & Technology).

It is a demonstration of basic collision physics and classes using a JavaScript canvas.

# To run (locally):

1. Download or clone the repository

2. Enter the project folder in the terminal (Mac) or CMD prompt (Windows)

3. Run 'npm install -g live-server'

4. Run 'live-server'

5. Open localhost in the browser

# Usage

As shown in the short video above,

The canvas displays a number of healthy, infected and immune molecules.

The user can use the GUI controls to adjust the size and / or number of molecules on the canvas.

If an infected molecule comes in contact or collides with one that is healthy, there is a high probability that it will become infected.
